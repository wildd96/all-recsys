,verified_buyer,color-mens-tree-flyers,,I love these running shoes.,I usually have a very difficult time finding running shoes that fit well and are comfortable even after the run. These shoes required zero break-in time and helped make running a pleasure. I was concerned that the mesh would snag on something and tear easily. It turns out they are fairly rugged and the mesh helps them conform to my feet perfectly.,5,2022-04-23T20:08:02.000Z

Spots still there so I used bleach/water combo to spot clean, now the spots are pinkish white. Basically shoes are trashed. Not happy ☹️",2,2019-04-11T20:43:46.000Z
